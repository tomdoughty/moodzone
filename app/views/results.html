		<h2>Where to get medical help for a low mood or anxiety</h2>
		<h3>Referring yourself for therapy</h3>
		<p>If you need more support, you can get free psychological therapies like cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) on the NHS.</p>
		<p>You can refer yourself directly to a psychological therapies service without a referral from your GP.</p>
